# ToDo

- right now the command can be anywhere in the string. we should check that the message starts with a '!'
- some commands might be !play youbue.com?asdfadf" this would play audio
- we should have an array of types of jokes it can send. currently only chuck norris jokes are supported
- !earthporn will grab a top photo from /r/earthporn and post it in chat. the image not just the link
- it would be cool if we could figure out how to pull out the more complicated tasks into their own file. dar says we should figure out how to import them like a module.
- !google <string> drops the first link in the response from google in chat
