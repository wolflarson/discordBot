# ToDo

- right now the command can be anywhere in the string. we should check that the message starts with a '!'
- get support for "!command" working
- some commands might be !play youbue.com?asdfadf" this would play audio
- !joke that would print a joke from an array
- !weather <city> that would print the weather for a given city
- !earthporn will grab a top photo from /r/earthporn and post it in chat. the image not just the link
- it would be cool if we could figure out how to pull out the more complicated tasks into their own file
- !google <string> drops the first link in the response from google in chat
